## Description:

Hello, this is one of the first few websites I made when I finished Mosh Hamedani's
course about [HTML and CSS](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-html-css).

Time passed and now I've made a new website! Which you can go check at the link leading
to my new website's repository below.
