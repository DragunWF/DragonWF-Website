        <p>
          Hallo, I'm DragonWF. Just my username, I'm not really confident at
          sharing my real name here but I'll be talking about stuff about myself
          with some exceptions of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a programmer who started programming back at 2019. That was when I
          first learned about the Godot Engine and GDscript. I didn't really
          code as much back then and my learning path was all over the place so
          I pretty much didn't improve as much during that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays I'm taking it seriously and found some good learning paths on
          where to start and what to do next and so far, I've actually made
          quite a lot of progress. Right now at the time I'm typing this, I've
          learned how to code in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Don't expect
          much from me yet as I only have 4 months of experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm planning to take BSIT in college, Bachelor of Science in
          Information Technology and that's also why I'm studying quite a lot in
          my free time and have been mostly spending my time to improve on my
          programming skills; So I can better prepare myself when I do get to
          college.
