        <p>
          Hallo, I'm DragonWF. Just my online username, I'm not really confident
          at sharing my real name here but I'll be talking about stuff about
          myself with some exceptions of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a programmer who started programming back at 2019. That was when I
          first learned about the GoDot Engine and GDscript. I didn't really
          program as much back then and my learning path was all over the place
          so I pretty much didn't improve as much during that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays I'm taking it seriously and found some good learning paths on
          where to start and what to do next and so far, I've actually made
          quite a lot of progress. Right now at the time I'm typing this, I've
          learned how to program in Python and JavaScript. I've also learned how
          to code in HTML5 and CSS3. Extra Note: I'm also planning to learn Java
          and C# at the near future once I get comfortable enough with
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm planning to take a BSIT in college, Bachelor of Science in
          Information Technology and that's also why I'm studying quite a lot in
          my free time and been mostly spending my time to improve on my
          programming skills; So I can better prepare myself when I do get to
          college.
